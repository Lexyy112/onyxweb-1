      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Onyx Care offers semi-independent and supported accommodation to young people between the
        age 16-21. We support the most vulnerable young people in their time of need and ensure that they
        have the opportunity to thrive, no matter what the circumstances or background. </p>

      <p class="about-us-text">Onyx Care offers semi-independent and supported accommodation to young people between the
        age 16-21. We support the most vulnerable young people in their time of need and ensure that they
        have the opportunity to thrive, no matter what the circumstances or background. </p>
      <p class="about-us-text">Predominantly, Onyx care supports young people who have been cared for by the Local Authority
        and are ready to or have to move out of residential care or foster homes. We also support separated
        migrant young people. We provide support and accommodation so that young people can
        eventually move on to independence in the timely, safe and planned way having been supported to
        overcome any challenges they have had in their lives. </p>
      <p class="about-us-text">We specialise in offering solo accommodation for the most vulnerable young people during their
        time of need and recognise that this particular group of vulnerable young people, require specialist
        support offered by the most resilient and creative workers who have a mandate to take a flexible
        approach to the support they provide. </p>
      <p class="about-us-text">Often the current circumstances and history may be a barrier to semi-independent providers offering
        accommodation to this specific group. Our approach is to ensure that we do not over stretch our
        resources by working with a small cohort of young people who can be given the specialist service
        they require. </p>

      <p class="about-us-text">Our staff team has a wealth of experience in Social Care and Youth Offending. As such, we can
        provide robust supervision and support in line with Court Orders, bail conditions and assessments of
        risk. </p>

          destination, independence. As you build independent living skills, we will help you to evidence your
